# Developer Environment Setup
> [!NOTE]
> In order to access the Trading Toolbox's package registry on GitHub, a personal access token needs to be created with the appropriate scopes and Visual Studio configured to use it. See the [Trading Toolbox Organization's README](https://github.com/trading-toolbox) which outlines how to create a PAT and configure Visual Studio to use it.

## Tooling
- .NET 7.0.x
- Visual Studio

## Dependencies
> [!NOTE]
> Referenced/restored via the project file

- MongoDB.Bson, 2.21.0
- TradingToolbox.System.Data.NoSql.MongoDB.Models, 5.1.0
- TradingToolbox.System.Data.NoSql.Repository, 5.1.0

# Usage
## Add NuGet Package To Project
```
dotnet add package TradingToolbox.System.Data.NoSql.MongoDB.Repository
```

## Update Source Code
```csharp
// For complete usage, see TradingToolbox.Trading.Modeler.Data.NoSql.MongoDB.Services

/// <summary>
/// Position model respository interface for position model documents.
/// </summary>
/// <seealso cref="IRepository{Models}" />
public interface IPositionModelRepository : IRepository<PositionModelDocument>
{
    // NOTE: using the generic IRepository interface from TradingToolbox.System.Data.NoSql.MongoDB.Repsitory
    // allows the implementing interface/class to specify a different data type for the underlying document
    // this repository to work with.
}

/// <summary>
/// Position model respository for position model documents.
/// </summary>
/// <seealso cref="TradingToolbox.System.Data.NoSql.MongoDB.Repsitory{PositionModelDocument}" />
/// <seealso cref="IPositionModelRepository" />
public class PositionModelRepository : Repository<PositionModelDocument>, IPositionModelRepository
{
    // NOTE: Concrete implementation of document respository for a PositionModelDocument.
}
```

# DevOps
## Configurations
- Release
    - This configuration is used for compilation of releases to non-debug environments, i.e. production and preview environments.
- Debug
    - This configuration is used for compilation of releases to development/debug environments.

## Branches
- main (production)
- staging (production preview)
- dev (developer integration)

## Local - Build, Pack(age) & Deploy
- To build/pack locally use the "Debug" configuration.

### Build
- To create NuGet build locally, can be done either in Visual Studio or command line.
  - Visual Studio
    - Load the project
    - Right-mouse clicking the project file to bring up the context menu and selecting "Build {project's name}".
  - Command Line
    - Open terminal.
    - Navigate to the project's root folder and issue the command "dotnet build -c:Debug".
  - Build Output
    - Build output for Visual Studio or command line, i.e. assembly, will be found in the "{project}/bin/Debug/" folder.

### Pack(age)
- To create NuGet package locally, can be done either in Visual Studio or command line.
  - Visual Studio
    - Load the project
    - Right-mouse clicking the project file to bring up the context menu and selecting "Pack {project's name}". 
  - Command Line
    - Open terminal.
    - Navigate to the project's root folder and issue the command "dotnet pack -c:Debug"
  - Pack Output
    - Pack command output for Visual Studio or command line, i.e. NuGet package file ".0.0.0-dev.nupkg", will be found in the "{project}/bin/Debug/" folder.
    - Because used the "Debug" configuration, the NuGet package version created is "0.0.0-dev" to communicate this is a NON-PRODUCTION build/package and should only be used for development/debug purposes; it should NEVER be uploaded to the Trading Toolbox organization's package registry on GitHub.
   
### Deployment
- A local deployment, in effect, is to a local "package source" folder and is configured in Visual Studio at "Visual Studio > Preferences > NuGet > Sources". This is useful when want to test changes to a package before pushing code changes to the project's repository.
- A locally built NuGet package can be deployed locally by copying the "{assembly-name}.0.0.0-dev.nupkg" to the local NuGet package source (i.e. a local folder) as configured in "Visual Studio > Preferences > NuGet > Sources".

## Cloud - Build, Pack(age) & Deploy
- Cloud based build/pack use the "Release" configuration, and currently, ONLY builds from the "main" branch.
- Cloud based build/pack/deploy use the [Production Release Workflow](https://github.com/trading-toolbox/production-release-workflow/actions/workflows/production-release-workflow.yml) Trading Toolbox Action to build and optionally pack/deploy a NuGet package for a selected project (i.e. repository).
- If opt to create a NuGet package, the resulting package will be uploaded to the [Trading Toolbox Package Registry](https://github.com/orgs/trading-toolbox/packages) on GitHub.
- As part of the [Production Release Workflow](https://github.com/trading-toolbox/production-release-workflow/actions/workflows/production-release-workflow.yml) build options, select what type of update the release is, e.g. "Major (Backwards-incompatible functionality added)", "Minor (Backwards-compatible functionality added)", or "Patch/Revision (Bugfixes/updates for a specific release)" to determine how the version number will be updated as part of the build. See [Trading Toolbox Org's README](https://github.com/trading-toolbox#version-numbers-in-trading-toolbox) for more information on version numbers in Trading Toolbox.
